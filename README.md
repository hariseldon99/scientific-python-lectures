A set of tutorials on scientific computing with Python, using jupyter notebooks.

Instructions
=========================
You can run these python codes by installing the requisite software in your computer, or online through [Google Colab](https://colab.research.google.com/).


1. In order to run these programs in your computer, perform the following steps.
    * **On regular console computers** (desktops or laptops), install the Git version control software after downloading it from its website @ [https://git-scm.com/](https://git-scm.com/)
    * Then, download this repository by cloning it using git (see [Git Basics](https://git-scm.com/book/en/v2/Git-Basics-Getting-a-Git-Repository)  for this).
    * Finally, download and install the anaconda python distribution (anaconda @ https://www.anaconda.com/). Anaconda includes [Jupyter notebooks](https://jupyter.org/) and the [Spyder IDE](https://www.spyder-ide.org/), either of which can be readily used for designing and running python code. Also, see [this blog entry](https://fangohr.github.io/blog/installation-of-python-spyder-numpy-sympy-scipy-pytest-matplotlib-via-anaconda.html) on how to install anaconda.
    * **Alternatively**, you can simply download a basic python installation (see the [Beginner's Guide to Python](https://wiki.python.org/moin/BeginnersGuide)) and use the included [IDLE IDE](https://docs.python.org/3/library/idle.html) for your programs.
      However, you will then have to install [Numerical Python](https://numpy.org), [Scientific Python](https://scipy.org) and [Matplotlib](https://matplotlib.org) manually using the [pip package manager](https://pypi.org/project/pip/). This is not necessary with anaconda.
    * **On Android devices**, you can install [Pydroid](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=ru.iiec.pydroid3) to design and run python programs. See [this video](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1xnr4iZRtfbx4LQ2d7Cl3fOdQ6Utb80zI/view?usp=sharing) for setup instructions. 
      I do not recommend using git or jupyter on mobile phones (too complicated for small screens), although git apps for Android do exist in the store. You can check them out if you wish. Alternative ways of getting these
      codes are discussed below.
          
2. For a quick introduction to the Python programming language, as well as [Numerical Python](https://numpy.org), [Scientific Python](https://scipy.org) and [Matplotlib](https://matplotlib.org), see [this tutorial](https://cs231n.github.io/python-numpy-tutorial/)

3. For a more detailed introduction to the abovementioned topics, see [Scientific Python Lectures](https://github.com/jrjohansson/scientific-python-lectures).

4. If you're having problems with Git, you can also navigate the codes using the links below and download each file independently. At the page of a particular code, click on the 'Raw' button on the 
top right corner to see the raw code file, then download it to your device by saving the page.

5. You can also simply copy-paste the codes individually into your local python setup. Click on the "Copy raw contents" button on the top-right corner of the github page of a particular code 
(to the right of the 'Blame' button), then paste it into a text editor or a running python IDE like [Spyder](https://www.spyder-ide.org/) or [Pydroid](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=ru.iiec.pydroid3) in order to execute it.

6. In case you cannot install Python locally on your computer, you may run the codes through [Google Colab](https://colab.research.google.com/) by clicking on the links to the jupyter notebooks below, then 
clicking on the "Open in Colab" button at the top of the notebook.
